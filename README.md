# BEN - Better, Easier Ncurses

A renaming, continuation/reimagining, and vast improvement of NCU (NCursesUtils). While NCU is a super cool acronym, BEN is my name and NCU ended up being not so much a collection of utilities, but rather a complete wrapper of ncurses.

## But why?
Glad you asked. Ncurses can be a pain to work with, but BEN is here to help.

With BEN, you can quickly get snazzy command line interfaces up and running quickly with minimal boilerplate code.

## But how?
Also a great question, theoretical person reading me. I haven't exactly built anything else out yet, so if your still reading this, I'm currently making magic happen or I've given up :/

## Count me in!
Your excitement for command line interfaces pleases me!

Right now, BEN is only going to be implemented in C++, but if this works out well enough, I'll try to port it to Python as well. Maybe even C, but don't quote me on that.
